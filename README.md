# Angular TodoList App
Angular project Created using Angular,Express.js,Node.js and MongoDB, using JSON Web Token Authentication

This project was created to expand my personal knowledge of Angular and the M.E.A.N stack

in this project you can create tasks, check them and delete them, keep in mind that you need a to register in order to use the app, you can create yours by clicking in the "Register" option in the navigation bar, I highly recommend you to not use any real and sensitive information when creating you account,since this app is made for learning purposes only and has little to none security. If you don't want to register any information, you can try logging in with the email "a@a.com" and with the password "123".
